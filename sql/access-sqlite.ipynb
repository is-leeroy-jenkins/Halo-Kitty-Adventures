    "Microsoft Access is not just a spreadsheet replacement — it’s a **relational database system** that uses a version of SQL known as **Jet/ACE SQL**.\n",
    "While the SQL syntax in Access looks similar to SQL Server or MySQL, it has unique behavior, functions, and data-type handling rules because it’s interpreted by the **Microsoft Access Database Engine (ACE)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will teach you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to write and understand SQL queries within Access\n",
    "* How to execute queries using **VBA**\n",
    "* How to combine Access forms, reports, and macros with SQL for automation and reporting\n",

    "\n",
    "### Where SQL Lives in Access\n",
    "\n",
    "Every Access database (`.accdb` or `.mdb`) has an underlying **database engine** (Jet for older versions, ACE for newer).\n",
    "When you create a query in the **Query Design View**, Access actually builds an SQL statement behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view or edit that statement directly by switching to **SQL View**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open the Query Designer.\n",
    "* Select **View → SQL View** from the toolbar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **SQL View** window is where Access interprets and stores SQL commands.\n",

    "### Using SQL in VBA\n",
    "\n",
    "Access’s **VBA environment** (Visual Basic for Applications) gives you full control over executing SQL.\n",
    "Two main approaches exist:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DAO (Data Access Objects)** – the most direct interface to Access tables and queries.\n",
    "2. **DoCmd methods** – used for running saved queries or executing SQL strings directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```vba\n",
    "' Run an action query (no results returned)\n",
    "CurrentDb.Execute \"UPDATE Employees SET Salary = Salary * 1.05;\", dbFailOnError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```vba\n",
    "' Open a recordset and read data\n",
    "Dim rs As DAO.Recordset\n",
    "Set rs = CurrentDb.OpenRecordset(\"SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees;\")\n",
    "Do While Not rs.EOF\n",
    "    Debug.Print rs!FirstName, rs!LastName\n",
    "    rs.MoveNext\n",
    "Loop\n",
    "rs.Close\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This dual environment — SQL inside Access and SQL inside VBA — is what makes Access both beginner-friendly and powerful for automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧱 SQL Basics in Access\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of every SQL statement in Access is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT field_list\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "WHERE criteria\n",
    "ORDER BY sort_order;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department\n",
    "FROM Employees\n",
    "WHERE Department = \"Finance\"\n",
    "ORDER BY LastName;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This retrieves all Finance employees and sorts them alphabetically by last name.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 SQL Execution Order in Access SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Jet/ACE engine** processes statements in a specific **logical order** that determines how results are built.\n",
    "Understanding this sequence explains many Access “mysteries,” such as why aliases aren’t recognized in the `WHERE` clause or why totals queries require the `HAVING` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Order of Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "| Step  | Clause           | Description                                   |\n",
    "| ----- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| **1** | `FROM`           | Load tables and perform joins or subqueries.  |\n",
    "| **2** | `WHERE`          | Filter individual rows (row-level filtering). |\n",
    "| **3** | `GROUP BY`       | Group the remaining rows into categories.     |\n",
    "| **4** | `HAVING`         | Filter groups based on aggregate results.     |\n",
    "| **5** | `SELECT`         | Return specific columns or expressions.       |\n",
    "| **6** | `ORDER BY`       | Sort the final result set.                    |\n",
    "| **7** | `TOP / DISTINCT` | Apply record limits or remove duplicates.     |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Department Salary Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary\n",
    "FROM Employees\n",
    "WHERE HireDate >= #1/1/2020#\n",
    "GROUP BY Department\n",
    "HAVING AVG(Salary) > 85000\n",
    "ORDER BY AvgSalary DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Execution flow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FROM** — Access retrieves all records from `Employees`.\n",
    "2. **WHERE** — Filters employees hired after January 1, 2020.\n",
    "3. **GROUP BY** — Groups remaining employees by department.\n",
    "4. **HAVING** — Keeps only groups with an average salary above $85,000.\n",
    "5. **SELECT** — Produces two columns: `Department` and the calculated `AvgSalary`.\n",
    "6. **ORDER BY** — Sorts results from highest to lowest average salary.\n",
    "7. **TOP** (if present) — Would then limit the number of rows returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations for Access\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Access executes JOINs first**, even before evaluating `WHERE` filters.\n",
    "  This means row combinations are formed before filtering — an important distinction when working with outer joins.\n",
    "* **Aliases defined in `SELECT` cannot be used in `WHERE`** because the `WHERE` clause executes first.\n",
    "  You can use aliases in `ORDER BY` since it executes last.\n",
    "* **`HAVING` is the only clause** that can reference aggregate functions such as `SUM()` or `AVG()`.\n",
    "* **`DISTINCT` and `TOP`** are applied *after* ordering — which is why applying `TOP 10` to an unordered query can yield inconsistent results.\n",
    "* **Totals Queries in Design View** correspond exactly to the `GROUP BY` → `HAVING` stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "| Common Confusion                                      | Explanation                                                             |\n",
    "| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| “Why does Access say my alias doesn’t exist?”         | Because the alias is created in `SELECT`, which runs after `WHERE`.     |\n",
    "| “Why can’t I filter averages in WHERE?”               | Aggregates don’t exist yet; you must use `HAVING`.                      |\n",
    "| “Why does changing JOIN type change my record count?” | Access executes joins before filtering, affecting which rows qualify.   |\n",
    "| “Why does TOP 10 behave differently each run?”        | Without `ORDER BY`, Access picks arbitrary rows — add explicit sorting. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical vs. Physical Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "This order represents the **logical** flow of SQL — the conceptual sequence the Jet/ACE engine uses.\n",
    "Internally, Access may reorder or optimize steps for performance (e.g., pushing filters earlier, using indexes, or caching joined tables).\n",

    "## 🧭 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQLite** is a lightweight, server-less, self-contained SQL database engine that stores all its data in a single file.\n",
    "It implements most of the SQL-92 standard and is used in everything from web browsers and mobile apps to embedded systems and operating-system utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike server databases (SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL), SQLite runs **in-process** with the application — there’s no external service to install or manage.\n",
    "You simply open a file, execute SQL statements, and the engine handles data persistence, indexing, and transactions automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide provides a comprehensive overview of **SQLite’s SQL dialect**, its data model, and its unique implementation details.\n",
    "All examples use clean SQL syntax with explanatory commentary below each code block.\n",

    "## ⚙️ Understanding SQLite Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is a **file-based relational database**.\n",
    "When you connect to a database such as `company.db`, SQLite creates (or opens) a single file on disk containing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tables (data)\n",
    "* Indexes\n",
    "* Views\n",
    "* Triggers\n",
    "* The database schema\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s no user authentication, no server configuration, and no networking — the database engine runs entirely in your application process.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite supports both **persistent databases** (`.db` files) and **in-memory databases** (`:memory:`) that exist only during program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧱 Basic SQL Structure\n",

    "The foundation of SQL in SQLite (and all relational systems) is built around four main statement categories:\n",

    "    Salary       REAL\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` defines a unique identifier. In SQLite, this automatically creates an **alias for the internal rowid** (a 64-bit integer unique to each record).\n",
    "* `TEXT`, `REAL`, and `INTEGER` are **type affinities**, not rigid types — SQLite stores values dynamically while maintaining data consistency.\n",
    "* `DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE` automatically inserts the current date on record creation.\n",
