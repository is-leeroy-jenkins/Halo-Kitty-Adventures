    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQLite** is a lightweight, server-less, self-contained SQL database engine that stores all its data in a single file.\n",
    "It implements most of the SQL-92 standard and is used in everything from web browsers and mobile apps to embedded systems and operating-system utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike server databases (SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL), SQLite runs **in-process** with the application — there’s no external service to install or manage.\n",
    "You simply open a file, execute SQL statements, and the engine handles data persistence, indexing, and transactions automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide provides a comprehensive overview of **SQLite’s SQL dialect**, its data model, and its unique implementation details.\n",
    "All examples use clean SQL syntax with explanatory commentary below each code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Understanding SQLite Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is a **file-based relational database**.\n",
    "When you connect to a database such as `company.db`, SQLite creates (or opens) a single file on disk containing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tables (data)\n",
    "* Indexes\n",
    "* Views\n",
    "* Triggers\n",
    "* The database schema\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s no user authentication, no server configuration, and no networking — the database engine runs entirely in your application process.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite supports both **persistent databases** (`.db` files) and **in-memory databases** (`:memory:`) that exist only during program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧱 Basic SQL Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of SQL in SQLite (and all relational systems) is built around four main statement categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Category                             | Purpose                           | Examples                                     |\n",
    "| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| **DDL (Data Definition Language)**   | Create or alter database objects. | `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, `CREATE INDEX` |\n",
    "| **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** | Insert, update, or delete data.   | `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`                 |\n",
    "| **DQL (Data Query Language)**        | Retrieve data.                    | `SELECT`, `WITH`, `JOIN`                     |\n",
    "| **DCL/Transaction Control**          | Manage changes.                   | `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`                |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section below explains these categories in practical detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Creating Tables and Schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables store data as rows and columns, similar to spreadsheets but strongly typed and indexed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "    EmployeeID   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    FirstName    TEXT NOT NULL,\n",
    "    LastName     TEXT NOT NULL,\n",
    "    Department   TEXT,\n",
    "    HireDate     TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,\n",
    "    Salary       REAL\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` defines a unique identifier. In SQLite, this automatically creates an **alias for the internal rowid** (a 64-bit integer unique to each record).\n",
    "* `TEXT`, `REAL`, and `INTEGER` are **type affinities**, not rigid types — SQLite stores values dynamically while maintaining data consistency.\n",
    "* `DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE` automatically inserts the current date on record creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Viewing Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "List all tables in the database:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    ".tables\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Show the schema of a specific table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    ".schema Employees\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✍️ Inserting Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Add rows using `INSERT INTO`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO Employees (FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary)\n",
    "VALUES ('Jane', 'Doe', 'Finance', 85000);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also insert multiple rows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO Employees (FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary)\n",
    "VALUES\n",
    "  ('John', 'Smith', 'HR', 72000),\n",
    "  ('Alice', 'Brown', 'IT', 95000),\n",
    "  ('Bob', 'Miller', 'Finance', 78000);\n",

    "## 🔍 Querying Data with SELECT\n",
    "\n",
    "The **SELECT** statement retrieves data from one or more tables.\n",

    "FROM Employees\n",
    "WHERE Department = 'Finance'\n",

    "SELECT FirstName || ' ' || LastName AS FullName, Salary AS AnnualPay\n",
    "FROM Employees;\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "Use logical and comparison operators to refine results.\n",

    "ORDER BY AvgSalary DESC\n",
    "LIMIT 5;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Execution flow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FROM** — SQLite loads the `Employees` table.\n",
    "2. **WHERE** — Filters rows to only those hired after 2020.\n",
    "3. **GROUP BY** — Groups remaining rows by `Department`.\n",
    "4. **HAVING** — Keeps only departments where `AVG(Salary) > 85000`.\n",
    "5. **SELECT** — Projects two columns: `Department` and the aggregate `AVG(Salary)`.\n",
    "6. **ORDER BY** — Sorts departments by `AvgSalary` descending.\n",
    "7. **LIMIT** — Returns the top five departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **`FROM`** and **`WHERE`** clauses act first — they determine *which rows* exist for grouping or aggregation.\n",
    "* **`SELECT`** actually happens *late*, which is why you can’t use column aliases in the `WHERE` clause.\n",
    "* **Aggregates (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.)** can only be used after grouping has occurred.\n",
    "* **`ORDER BY`** and **`LIMIT`** apply to the *final result set*, not to individual groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Physical vs. Logical Order\n",
    "\n",
    "The above order describes **logical processing**, not necessarily the physical sequence of operations inside SQLite’s query planner.\n",
    "Internally, SQLite may:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Optimize joins\n",
    "* Reorder filters\n",
    "* Use indexes\n",
    "  to execute queries more efficiently.\n",
    "  However, the *logical model* above remains the conceptual blueprint you should rely on when reasoning about query behavior.\n",

    "* SQLite is **serverless** — everything lives in one file.\n",
    "* It uses **dynamic typing** and **type affinities** rather than rigid data types.\n",
    "* Supports **transactions, joins, triggers, and views** fully.\n",
    "* Ideal for lightweight applications, local storage, and data interchange.\n",
