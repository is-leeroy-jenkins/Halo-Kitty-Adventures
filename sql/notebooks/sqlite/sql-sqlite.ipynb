    "## 🧭 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SQLite** is a lightweight, server-less, self-contained SQL database engine that stores all its data in a single file. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It implements most of the SQL-92 standard and is used in everything from web browsers and mobile apps to embedded systems and operating-system utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unlike server databases (SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL), SQLite runs **in-process** with the application — there’s no external service to install or manage. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You simply open a file, execute SQL statements, and the engine handles data persistence, indexing, and transactions automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This guide provides a comprehensive overview of **SQLite’s SQL dialect**, its data model, and its unique implementation details. All examples use clean SQL syntax with explanatory commentary below each code block."
