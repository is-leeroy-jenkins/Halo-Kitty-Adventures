    "## 🧭 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SQLite** is a lightweight, server-less, self-contained SQL database engine that stores all its data in a single file. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It implements most of the SQL-92 standard and is used in everything from web browsers and mobile apps to embedded systems and operating-system utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unlike server databases (SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL), SQLite runs **in-process** with the application — there’s no external service to install or manage. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You simply open a file, execute SQL statements, and the engine handles data persistence, indexing, and transactions automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This guide provides a comprehensive overview of **SQLite’s SQL dialect**, its data model, and its unique implementation details. All examples use clean SQL syntax with explanatory commentary below each code block."

    "SQLite is a **file-based relational database**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you connect to a database such as `company.db`, SQLite creates (or opens) a single file on disk containing:\n",

    "* Tables (data)\n",

    "* Indexes\n",

    "* Views\n",

    "* The database schema\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s no user authentication, no server configuration, and no networking — the database engine runs entirely in your application process.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite supports both **persistent databases** (`.db` files) and **in-memory databases** (`:memory:`) that exist only during program execution."

    "|-----------|----------|-----------|\n",
    "| **DDL (Data Definition Language)** | Create or alter database objects. | `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, `CREATE INDEX` |\n",
    "| **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** | Insert, update, or delete data. | `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` |\n",
    "| **DQL (Data Query Language)** | Retrieve data. | `SELECT`, `WITH`, `JOIN` |\n",
    "| **DCL/Transaction Control** | Manage changes. | `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK` |\n",
