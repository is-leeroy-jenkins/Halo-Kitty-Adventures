    "Microsoft Access is not just a spreadsheet replacement — it’s a **relational database system** that uses a version of SQL known as **Jet/ACE SQL**.\n",
    "While the SQL syntax in Access looks similar to SQL Server or MySQL, it has unique behavior, functions, and data-type handling rules because it’s interpreted by the **Microsoft Access Database Engine (ACE)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will teach you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to write and understand SQL queries within Access\n",
    "* How to execute queries using **VBA**\n",
    "* How to combine Access forms, reports, and macros with SQL for automation and reporting\n",

    "We’ll move gradually from basic query construction to advanced topics like parameter queries, joins, subqueries, and crosstab reports — all written in clean Access SQL.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Where SQL Lives in Access\n",
    "\n",
    "Every Access database (`.accdb` or `.mdb`) has an underlying **database engine** (Jet for older versions, ACE for newer).\n",
    "When you create a query in the **Query Design View**, Access actually builds an SQL statement behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view or edit that statement directly by switching to **SQL View**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open the Query Designer.\n",
    "* Select **View → SQL View** from the toolbar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **SQL View** window is where Access interprets and stores SQL commands.\n",

    "### Using SQL in VBA\n",
    "\n",
    "Access’s **VBA environment** (Visual Basic for Applications) gives you full control over executing SQL.\n",
    "Two main approaches exist:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DAO (Data Access Objects)** – the most direct interface to Access tables and queries.\n",
    "2. **DoCmd methods** – used for running saved queries or executing SQL strings directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```vba\n",
    "' Run an action query (no results returned)\n",
    "CurrentDb.Execute \"UPDATE Employees SET Salary = Salary * 1.05;\", dbFailOnError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```vba\n",
    "' Open a recordset and read data\n",
    "Dim rs As DAO.Recordset\n",
    "Set rs = CurrentDb.OpenRecordset(\"SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees;\")\n",
    "Do While Not rs.EOF\n",
    "    Debug.Print rs!FirstName, rs!LastName\n",
    "    rs.MoveNext\n",
    "Loop\n",
    "rs.Close\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This dual environment — SQL inside Access and SQL inside VBA — is what makes Access both beginner-friendly and powerful for automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧱 SQL Basics in Access\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of every SQL statement in Access is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT field_list\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "WHERE criteria\n",
    "ORDER BY sort_order;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department\n",
    "FROM Employees\n",
    "WHERE Department = \"Finance\"\n",
    "ORDER BY LastName;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This retrieves all Finance employees and sorts them alphabetically by last name.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 SQL Execution Order in Access SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Jet/ACE engine** processes statements in a specific **logical order** that determines how results are built.\n",
    "Understanding this sequence explains many Access “mysteries,” such as why aliases aren’t recognized in the `WHERE` clause or why totals queries require the `HAVING` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Order of Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "| Step  | Clause           | Description                                   |\n",
    "| ----- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| **1** | `FROM`           | Load tables and perform joins or subqueries.  |\n",
    "| **2** | `WHERE`          | Filter individual rows (row-level filtering). |\n",
    "| **3** | `GROUP BY`       | Group the remaining rows into categories.     |\n",
    "| **4** | `HAVING`         | Filter groups based on aggregate results.     |\n",
    "| **5** | `SELECT`         | Return specific columns or expressions.       |\n",
    "| **6** | `ORDER BY`       | Sort the final result set.                    |\n",
    "| **7** | `TOP / DISTINCT` | Apply record limits or remove duplicates.     |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Department Salary Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary\n",
    "FROM Employees\n",
    "WHERE HireDate >= #1/1/2020#\n",
    "GROUP BY Department\n",
    "HAVING AVG(Salary) > 85000\n",
    "ORDER BY AvgSalary DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Execution flow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FROM** — Access retrieves all records from `Employees`.\n",
    "2. **WHERE** — Filters employees hired after January 1, 2020.\n",
    "3. **GROUP BY** — Groups remaining employees by department.\n",
    "4. **HAVING** — Keeps only groups with an average salary above $85,000.\n",
    "5. **SELECT** — Produces two columns: `Department` and the calculated `AvgSalary`.\n",
    "6. **ORDER BY** — Sorts results from highest to lowest average salary.\n",
    "7. **TOP** (if present) — Would then limit the number of rows returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations for Access\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Access executes JOINs first**, even before evaluating `WHERE` filters.\n",
    "  This means row combinations are formed before filtering — an important distinction when working with outer joins.\n",
    "* **Aliases defined in `SELECT` cannot be used in `WHERE`** because the `WHERE` clause executes first.\n",
    "  You can use aliases in `ORDER BY` since it executes last.\n",
    "* **`HAVING` is the only clause** that can reference aggregate functions such as `SUM()` or `AVG()`.\n",
    "* **`DISTINCT` and `TOP`** are applied *after* ordering — which is why applying `TOP 10` to an unordered query can yield inconsistent results.\n",
    "* **Totals Queries in Design View** correspond exactly to the `GROUP BY` → `HAVING` stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "| Common Confusion                                      | Explanation                                                             |\n",
    "| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| “Why does Access say my alias doesn’t exist?”         | Because the alias is created in `SELECT`, which runs after `WHERE`.     |\n",
    "| “Why can’t I filter averages in WHERE?”               | Aggregates don’t exist yet; you must use `HAVING`.                      |\n",
    "| “Why does changing JOIN type change my record count?” | Access executes joins before filtering, affecting which rows qualify.   |\n",
    "| “Why does TOP 10 behave differently each run?”        | Without `ORDER BY`, Access picks arbitrary rows — add explicit sorting. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical vs. Physical Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "This order represents the **logical** flow of SQL — the conceptual sequence the Jet/ACE engine uses.\n",
    "Internally, Access may reorder or optimize steps for performance (e.g., pushing filters earlier, using indexes, or caching joined tables).\n",
